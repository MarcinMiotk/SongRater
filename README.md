## Setting up database
To set up developement database you have to go to vagrantfile directory by executing command: 
`cd vagrant/` and then use `vagrant up`. After completing you will have fully working virtual machine with **PostgreSQL** database for development with credentials:

```
login: songrater 
password: songrater
forwarded port:  5432 
```

To stop virtual machine you have to run `vagrant halt` in vagrantfile directory.
